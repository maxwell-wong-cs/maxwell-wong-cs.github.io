          <h2>Despicable Me ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Feb 2022)</h2>
          <p>A perfect family film. Gru's grumpy charm is great, the three girls are adorable, and the Minions are pure comedy gold. The story is sweet and satisfying, even if it's a bit predictable. Always an enjoyable watch!</p>

          <h2>The Boss Baby ⭐⭐⭐ (March 2023)</h2>
          <p>I thought it was really funny when the baby talks like a grown-up in a suit! The part with the puppies was cool. My little sister laughed a lot. Sometimes it got a little confusing with all the boss stuff, and I liked the brother team-up at the end. It’s not my favorite movie ever, but it’s good. I’d watch it again if there was nothing else on.</p>

          <h2>Kim's Convenience ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Aug 2025)</h2>
          <p>Just binged all of Kim's Convenience and I'm obsessed. This show is the perfect mix of hilarious and heartwarming. Mr. and Mrs. Kim ("Appa" and "Umma") are the funniest, most relatable parents ever—Appa's stubbornness and Umma's sneakiness kill me every time. The bond between Janet and Jung is so real, and their family dynamics fee</p>
