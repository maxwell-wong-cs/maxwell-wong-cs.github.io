          <h2>Despicable Me ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (February 2022)</h2>
          <p>A perfect family film. Gru's grumpy charm is great, the three girls are adorable, and the Minions are pure comedy gold. The story is sweet and satisfying, even if it's a bit predictable. Always an enjoyable watch!</p>

          <h2>The Boss Baby ⭐⭐⭐ (March 2023)</h2>
          <p>I thought it was really funny when the baby talks like a grown-up in a suit! The part with the puppies was cool. My little sister laughed a lot. Sometimes it got a little confusing with all the boss stuff, and I liked the brother team-up at the end. It’s not my favorite movie ever, but it’s good. I’d watch it again if there was nothing else on.</p>

          <h2>Kim's Convenience ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (August 2025)</h2>
          <p>Just binged all of Kim's Convenience and I'm obsessed. This show is the perfect mix of hilarious and heartwarming. Mr. and Mrs. Kim ("Appa" and "Umma") are the funniest, most relatable parents ever—Appa's stubbornness and Umma's sneakiness kill me every time. The bond between Janet and Jung is so real, and their family dynamics fee.</p>

          <h2>The Good Doctor ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (August 2025)</h2>
          <p>Freddie Highmore’s performance as Dr. Shaun Murphy is phenomenal—he makes you truly invest in his journey, and his unique perspective is the show’s greatest strength. The medical cases are intense and clever, and the supporting cast (I’m looking at you, Dr. Glassman and Dr. Lim) adds great depth.</p>

          <h2>Stranger Things ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (December 2025)</h2>
          <p>This series is an absolute vibe. The 80s aesthetic, killer soundtrack, and core friend group (shoutout to Dustin and Steve) are pure perfection. The mystery in Season 1 was flawless, and the show creates moments of genuine terror and heart.</p>

          <h2>Rick and Morty ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (August 2025)</h2>
          <p>This show is genius, full stop. It’s the perfect blend of insane, multiverse-hopping sci-fi and razor-sharp satire that actually makes you think. The animation is wild, the concepts are brilliantly unhinged (Pickle Rick, anyone?), and the jokes hit at a million miles an hour.</p>
